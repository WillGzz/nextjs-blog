/*
In Next.js, a page is a React Component exported from a file in the pages directory.

Pages are associated with a route based on their file name. For example, in development:

pages/index.js is associated with the / route.
pages/posts/first-post.js is associated with the /posts/first-post route.

In Next.js, you can use the Link Component next/link to link between pages in your application.
 <Link> allows you to do client-side navigation and accepts props that give you better control over the navigation behavior.

 Client-side navigation means that the page transition happens using JavaScript, which is faster than the default navigation done by the browser.

 next/image allows for resizing, optimizing, and serving images in modern formats like WebP when the browser supports it.
  This avoids shipping large images to devices with a smaller viewport



       Third-party JavaScript refers to any scripts that are added from a third-party source. Usually, third-party scripts are included in order to 
       introduce newer functionality into a site that does not need to be written from scratch, such as analytics, ads, and customer support widgets.

       CSS modules allow you to locally scope CSS at the component-level by automatically creating unique class names. 
       This allows you to use the same CSS class name in different files without worrying about class name collisions.
Next.js has two forms of pre-rendering: Static Generation and Server-side Rendering. The difference is in when it generates the HTML for a page.

Static Generation is the pre-rendering method that generates the HTML at build time. The pre-rendered HTML is then reused on each request.
Server-side Rendering is the pre-rendering method that generates the HTML on each request.

Static Generation can be done with and without data.
